# That Game (that I wanted to make forever)

After making my first [multiplayer game](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/multiplayerGameCodinClub), I had been wanting to make a more complex one for a while. Inspired by classic .io games, I had wanted to make an online platformer forever; hence, young me named the project "that game," as in "that game I had tried and failed to make a ton of times." I had tried to continue using the Firebase database for a while, but that failed quickly when physics got involved. For this game I tried using socket.io, and that definitely gave me a boost in speed. The only issue was that I was sending player data as full objects instead of strings, giving me a massive drop in speed.

## Controls

* arrow keys move
* space to attack
* objective: collect treasure!

> If you wish to play the game it is available right [here](https://banditbashapi.onrender.com/) (NOTE: like the rest of my games this is on free servers and may take a bit to spin up).
