# That Game (that I wanted to make forever)

After making my first [multiplayer game]() I had been wanting to make a more complex one for a while. Inspired by classsic .io games I had wanted to make a online platformer forever hence young me naming the proejct "that game" as in "that game I had tried and failed to make a ton of times". I had tried to continue using firebase database for a while but that failed my quickly when physics got involved. For this game I tried using socket.io and that definitally gave me a boost in speed. The only issue was that I was sending player data as full objects instead of string giving me a massive drop in speed.

> If you wish to play the game it is available right [here](https://banditbashapi.onrender.com/) (NOTE: like the rest of my games this is on free servers and may take a bit to spin up).
